InfoBot
=======
InfoBot just needs to be named at the start of a message, and it will reply with a report of all the values that Zulip needs to understand your message. Currently it can only be invoked in public channels. InfoBot might be useful for other bot developers getting started, and might help pinpoint interesting things about how Zulip functions! InfoBot was started from the source code for Bot-Builder https://github.com/di0spyr0s/Bot-Builder

API
===
InfoBot can only be used by Hacker School Zulip users. All you have to do to use it is say "InfoBot" and it will reply. It has two optional parameters:  
-v, --verbose   turns on verbose output
-nb, --no-box   stops output from being boxed
